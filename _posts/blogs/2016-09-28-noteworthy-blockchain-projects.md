* TransActive Grid: TransActive Grid is combination of ​software ​and hardware ​that enables members to buy and sell energy from each other securely and automatically, using smart contracts and the blockchain.

* Intelligent Grid Systems: Together these can create a community market sharing economy that is more resilient, energy efficient and gives prosumers control over their own energy choices.
