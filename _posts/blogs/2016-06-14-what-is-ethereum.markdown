Ethereum is a public blockchain-based distributed computing platform, featuring smart contract functionality. It provides a decentralized virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), that can execute peer-to-peer contracts using a cryptocurrency called ether.


* Applications build with Ethereum do not cover all use cases of course, but have specific properties that make them unique:
* Ethereum applications always execute the code they say they will - there is no 'security through obscurity'. I don't need to 'trust' anything or anyone, because I can check the app code myself.
* Ethereum applications are always available, and are guaranteed to be available in the future. There is no downtime.
Ethereum applications are resistant to many attacks including denial of service (DDoS), which are rendered moot.
