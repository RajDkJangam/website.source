ECMAScript 6 (ES6, often referred to as Harmony) is the upcoming sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification.The technology bringing a lot of amazing features that we will need to know. One of the main feature that introducing by the  ES6 is "Javascript Classes".

## Classes   
Classes are the main  new OOP paradigm in ES6 which make code syntatic sugar.That means classes make prototype-based OO pattern much simpler and boosts interoperability.Classes supports inheritance,instance and static methods which makes ES6 more user friendly.

## Class body and methods   
The body of a class is enclosed in curly braces {}.Here we can define methods or constructors.

## Constructor:
A special method for creating and initializing an object created with a class.

**Example:**   

```
class Number{
    constructor(num1, num2) {
        this.num1 = num1;
        this.num2 = num2;
    }
    calcSum() {
        return this.num1 + this.num2;  
    }
    getSum(){
        return this.calcSum();
    }
}
numOperation = new Number(20, 10);
console.log(numOperation.getSum);
```

## Subclassing using extend keyword:
The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class as a child of another class.

**Example:**   

```
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name + ' makes a noise.');
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(this.name + ' barks.');
    }
}
```
