Elm is a language that compiles to JavaScript, or in other words, Elm is a language to generate functional JavaScript code.

> This guide is talking about installing and setting up elm version 0.17.1

## Why we need Elm?
Elm is a programming language for declaratively creating web browser-based graphical user interfaces. Elm is `purely functional`, and is developed with emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. It advertises "no runtime exceptions in practice", made possible by the Elm compiler's static type checking.

## Features of Elm

1. JavaScript Interop
2. No Runtime Exceptions
3. Great Performance
4. Enforced Semantic Versioning

Read [details](http://elm-lang.org).

## 1. Installing Elm Platform.

You can download the latest package from [here](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-compiler/releases).

OR

1. Mac [Installer](http://install.elm-lang.org/Elm-Platform-0.17.1.pkg)
