## What is an ICO?
ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a means for blockchain startups to raise capital from the public that is somewhat equivalent to an IPO in the stock markets.

Everyone looks at the massive opportunity with ICOs, and one rarely looks at the downside risks involved for doing one well, but sloppy at the same time. It’s only been a year since the last hiccup in the blockchain/crypto world, and we seem to have forgotten what actual risks are involved with this type of technology, and emerging form of social trust. However we would like to outline the process of doing an ICO in a proper way from a consultancy perspective.
