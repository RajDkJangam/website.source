Solidity is a high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to compile to code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. As you will see, it is possible to create contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets and more.

Solidity is the programming language that we use to create Etherem based Smart Contracts.

I have covered the steps to install Solidity in my previous blog [Compile and Deploy Solidity
Contract](https://lightrains.com/blogs/compile-deploy-solidity-contract-ethereum-console-geth-part-1)
