ES6 introduces many new features to embrace the developer as well as the browsers to perform
in a optimal performant way.

## Set
Set is new type of data structure that we can use to store **Unique** values which can be of
any type but they must all be uniqie.

**Create a Set**

To create a set we use `Set` constructor `var mySet = new Set();`

**Add Values to set**

```
let myArray = [1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 0, 0]
let mySet = new Set(myArray)
```

Now if you do a `console.log(mySet);` you will see
`Set {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 0}`

## Map

Map is similar to `Set` but it manges key-value pair instead of individual values.

**Create a Map**

`var myMap = new Map();` will create an instance of `Map` and to add values to it we can do `let
myOtherMap = new Map([['a', 2], [1, 'b']])`

`console.log(myOtherMap);` will show `Map {"a" => 2, 1 => "b"}`

## WeakSet and WeakMap
Similar to regular Map and Set but the difference is that the object references inside them are
held weakly. So it wont prevent garbage collection.
