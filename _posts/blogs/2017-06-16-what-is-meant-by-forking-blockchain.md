You might heard of the term [forking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development) many times in the last few years, if you are in the Blockchain industry by any chance. Here we are attempting to provide a clear understanding of what is meant by forking.

It is not a blockchain specific term;

> In software engineering, a project fork happens when developers take a copy of source code from one software package and start independent development on it, creating a distinct and separate piece of software.


## What is meant by forking in Blockchain - basics
At its most basic, a fork is what happens when a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) diverges into two potential paths forward — either with regard to a network’s transaction history or a new rule in deciding what makes a transaction valid. But forks also can be willingly introduced to the network. This occurs when developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.

### What is meant by forking in Blockchain - advanced
*Forking in each and every Blockchain is different, based on the design architecture and use case the chain. We shall look into a more generic scenario.*

**Fork can happen in following situations**
1. Anytime two miners find a block at nearly the same time.
2. Developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not.

## Types of Forks
**Soft fork:** by contrast, is any change that's backward compatible.

**Hard fork:** is a software upgrade that introduces a new rule to the network that isn't compatible with the older software

**User-activated soft fork (UASF):** is a controversial idea that explores how a blockchain might add an upgrade that is not directly supported by those who provide the network's hashing power.



## What happens when the blockchain forks?
It’s actually quite simple: you get two chains with a shared genesis and are identical up until the forking point, after which they exist exclusively in parallel (unless one is completely abandoned), creating two separate networks.
