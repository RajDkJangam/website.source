Big news! Today, after five years, we’re releasing an updated brand identity, which includes a new logo, colors, and font. You’ll see the new look anywhere we’re out in public, like our website, Facebook, and Twitter; very soon you’ll see it in all of our products, as well.

We started by distilling the essence of our brand down to its colors on a clean white background—and built it back up.

Our design goal was to better match how we look to our values and the users we serve. A small team inside the company worked to find something that appeared crisp, approachable, smart, friendly, and connected.

## Path to the current logo

## Though it was time for change,
We’re still the same team: focused on Consulting & Development on [Blockchain](/consulting/blockchain-consulting), [Drupal](/consulting/drupal-consulting-development) and [ES6](/consulting/es6-javascript-development).

As we begin this new chapter in Vision’s history, we are appreciative of each one of our customers, who collaborate with us daily to create next generation technology. We look forward to continued partnership and great things to come.

Sincerely,

Nikhil Mohan
COO
