As your Drupal site grows, more visitors and more page views are served. This puts more load on your server, and often bottlenecks cause the site to be slow, or experience hangs occasionally. If your Drupal site has performance issues, we can help by investigating the performance issues you are experiencing.

Our performance assessment, optimization and tuning service covers Drupal as well as Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) or even Linux, Nginx, MySQL and PHP (LEMP). The outcome is a faster running site with optimal usage of existing resources, such as CPU, memory and disk.

In order for your server to have the best performance with Drupal, it has to be properly configured with the right software versions of the many component needed, and tuned for optimal performance and uptime.

We recommend that your web host install only a a minimal Linux distro, without any web servers, database or PHP. We will then do the following for you:

 * Install Apache, MySQL, PHP, APC and Memcached and/or Varnish.
 * Configure and optimize the above for Drupal to run smoothly and efficiently.
 * Install and configure awstats for web server statistics, so you can check regularly how your web site's traffic is doing.
 * Install and configure Munin for resource monitoring, so you can keep an eye on web site growth and resource utilization over the weeks, months and years to come.
 * Daily backup of your web site.
 * If you already have a web site, we can move it to your new server if needed.

We can also recommend hosting companies that we have used in the past and found that their service is good or excellent.
